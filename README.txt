This was my introduction to working with APIs.  It was part of a follow-along tutorial project that covered a few new bases:

API setup, requests, date retreival, and finally data usage once retreived.

Setting up custom properties in the root.

Creating containers that would be populated by the incoming data.

Pagination in JS, with card population using the forEach method.

Fetch method, switch statements, rendering HTML to create info cards, and a variety of event listeners.

This was a very fun project to work on, as it really opened my mind to the possibilities of using fetched data in interesting ways.  I loved creating the info card and then running JS to populate as many as needed.
